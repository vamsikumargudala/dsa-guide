1. **Basic Algorithms**:
   - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)
   - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
   - Recursion and Backtracking

2. **Intermediate Algorithms**:
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   - Depth-First Search (DFS)
   - Dynamic Programming (DP)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Two-Pointer Technique
   - Sliding Window

3. **Advanced Algorithms**:
   - Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
   - Bellman-Ford Algorithm
   - Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
   - Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms (Minimum Spanning Tree)
   - Topological Sorting
   - Knapsack Problem (0/1 and Unbounded)
   - Bit Manipulation

### **Step 3: Master Problem-Solving Patterns**
These patterns are recurring strategies to solve DSA problems. Learn and practice them:

1. **Two Pointers**:
   - Used in problems like "Two Sum," "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array."

2. **Sliding Window**:
   - Used in problems like "Maximum Subarray," "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters."

3. **Fast and Slow Pointers**:
   - Used in problems like "Linked List Cycle," "Find the Middle of a Linked List."

4. **Merge Intervals**:
   - Used in problems like "Merge Intervals," "Insert Interval."

5. **Cyclic Sort**:
   - Used in problems like "Find the Missing Number," "Find All Duplicates in an Array."

6. **In-Place Reversal of a Linked List**:
   - Used in problems like "Reverse a Linked List."

7. **Tree BFS/DFS**:
   - Used in problems like "Binary Tree Level Order Traversal," "Path Sum."

8. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:
   - Learn top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches.
   - Patterns: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Fibonacci, etc.

9. **Backtracking**:
   - Used in problems like "Subsets," "Permutations," "N-Queens."

10. **Greedy Algorithms**:
    - Used in problems like "Coin Change," "Activity Selection."

11. **Bit Manipulation**:
    - Used in problems like "Single Number," "Count Set Bits."

Here’s a **6-month plan** to learn DSA and solve problems:

#### **Month 1: Basics**
- Focus on Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.
- Solve 1-2 problems daily on LeetCode (Easy difficulty).
- Learn sorting and searching algorithms.

#### **Month 2: Intermediate**
- Learn Trees, Heaps, and Graphs.
- Practice BFS, DFS, and Recursion.
- Solve 1-2 problems daily (Easy-Medium difficulty).

#### **Month 3: Advanced Data Structures**
- Learn Tries, Segment Trees, and Disjoint Set Union.
- Practice Dynamic Programming (start with Fibonacci, Knapsack).
- Solve 1-2 problems daily (Medium difficulty).

#### **Month 4: Problem-Solving Patterns**
- Focus on Two Pointers, Sliding Window, and Greedy Algorithms.
- Practice 1-2 problems daily (Medium difficulty).

#### **Month 5: Advanced Algorithms**
- Learn Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, and Floyd-Warshall Algorithms.

### **Step 7: Tips for Success**
1. **Consistency is Key**: Solve problems daily, even if it's just one.
2. **Understand, Don’t Memorize**: Focus on understanding the underlying patterns.
3. **Review Solutions**: If you can’t solve a problem, study the solution and re-attempt it later.
4. **Mock Interviews**: Practice with a friend or use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io.
5. **Track Progress**: Use a spreadsheet to track problems solved and patterns learned.
