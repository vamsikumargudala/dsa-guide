# Problem-Solving Patterns

## 1. Two Pointers
- **Use Case**: Problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists.
- **Examples**: Two Sum, Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array.

## 2. Sliding Window
- **Use Case**: Problems involving subarrays or substrings.
- **Examples**: Maximum Subarray, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters.

## 3. Fast and Slow Pointers
- **Use Case**: Problems involving cycles in linked lists or arrays.
- **Examples**: Linked List Cycle, Find the Middle of a Linked List.

## 4. Merge Intervals
- **Use Case**: Problems involving overlapping intervals.
- **Examples**: Merge Intervals, Insert Interval.

## 5. Dynamic Programming
- **Use Case**: Problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- **Examples**: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence.

## 6. Backtracking
- **Use Case**: Problems involving permutations, combinations, or subsets.
- **Examples**: Subsets, Permutations, N-Queens.

## 7. Bit Manipulation
- **Use Case**: Problems involving binary operations.
- **Examples**: Single Number, Count Set Bits.
